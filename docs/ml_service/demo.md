## What's this about?
It's a project building a machine learning service from scratch. From the model training to its deployment.
From building backend REST API to frontend interface.

## A quick demo
Hit the endpoint `allyoushawn.hopto.org:8080/ml_service` through a browser, we could start using the ML service.
