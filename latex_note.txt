The $$latex expression$$ might encounter weird issue if it is put at the first line of a sentence,

See the below example on the github.io rendering to get more understanding

# Example 1, the example that would have issues
Test again 2 $$\mathbb{E}[Y(1)|X=x] = \mathbb{E}[Y|T=1, X=x]$$.

# Example 2, the example that resolve issues
Test again 2
$$\mathbb{E}[Y(1)|X=x] = \mathbb{E}[Y|T=1, X=x]$$.

# Other examples below during testing just for archive purpose
# Example
Under this setting, people who see the ad are often systematically different from those who don’t,
creating **confounding**. For example, people seeing the ad might intrinsically have higher tendency to purchase.
The $$\mathbb{E}[Y|T=1, X=x]$$ obtained through the dataset will have **confounding bias**
since it's being inflated by the mentioned phenomenon
when we compare it to the true value we want $$\mathbb{E}[Y|T=1, X=x]$$.
